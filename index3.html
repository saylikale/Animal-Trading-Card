			<p class="tiger-info">Tigers are the largest felines in the world, most recognizable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.<br> Many cultures consider the tiger to be a symbol of strength and courage.<br>However, because hunting them is also a sign of bravery in some cultures, tigers are endangered; no more than 3,200 tigers are left in the wild.<br>All tigers are carnivores. Most of a tiger's diet consists of large prey, such as pigs, deer, rhinos or elephant calves. To kill their prey, tigers will clamp down on the animal's neck with their jaws and suffocate the animal.<br>They like to spend most of their time alone, roaming their massive territories looking for food. Tigers mark their territory by scratching marks into trees with their claws.</p>
